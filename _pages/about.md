About me
======
I'm an undergraduate senior at Rice University pursuing B.S. Electrical Engineering and B.A. Statistics degrees. My research interests include Ubiquitous and Mobile Computing, Mobile Health, Wearable Computing, Activity Recognition, Machine Learning and Signal Processing. I want to pursue a PhD in these fields to build systems and models to understand people’s behaviors and improve their health and quality of life. At Rice, I had research experience in [Computational Wellbeing Group](https://compwell.rice.edu/home) under Prof. [Akane Sano](http://akane.sano.web.rice.edu/index.html)’s supervision, where I worked on machine learning models for wellbeing predictions with mobile and wearable sensing. I also worked with Prof. [Behnaam Aazhang](https://aaz.rice.edu/) on Alzheimer's Disease diagnosis with MRI and machine learning. For more information about me, please check my CV. Thank you very much!
