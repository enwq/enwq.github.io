My research interests include Ubiquitous and Mobile Computing, Mobile Health, Wearable Computing, Activity Recognition, Machine Learning and Signal Processing. I want to pursue a PhD in these fields to build systems and models to understand peopleâ€™s behaviors and improve their health and quality of life. At Rice, I had research experience in [Computational Wellbeing Group](https://compwell.rice.edu/home) where I worked on machine learning models
