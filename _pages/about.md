About me
======
I'm an undergraduate senior at Rice University pursuing B.S. Electrical Engineering and B.A. Statistics degrees. My research interests include Ubiquitous and Mobile Computing, Mobile Health, Wearable Computing, Activity Recognition, Machine Learning and Signal Processing. I want to pursue a PhD in these fields to build systems and models to understand people’s behaviors and improve their health and quality of life. At Rice, I had research experience in [Computational Wellbeing Group](https://compwell.rice.edu/home) under Prof. [Akane Sano](http://akane.sano.web.rice.edu/index.html)’s supervision, where I worked on machine learning models for wellbeing predictions with mobile and wearable sensing. I also worked with Prof. [Behnaam Aazhang](https://aaz.rice.edu/) on Alzheimer's Disease diagnosis with MRI and machine learning. Here is my [CV](https://enwq.github.io/files/Yufei_Shen_CV.pdf) for more information about me. Thank you very much!

Research Experience
=======

Schizophrenia Patients’ Symptom Prediction with Mobile Phone Sensing
------
- Developed user-dependent and user-independent Gaussian Process and Long Short-Term Memory regression models to predict Schizophrenia patients’ self-assessment scores of ten symptoms with behavioral and environmental data collected from mobile phone sensing
- Personalized the independent models by fine-tuning transfer learning and clustering participants’ daily behavior patterns and demographic information
- Extended the system from predicting symptoms for only one day to 30 days with a Long Short-Term Memory classification model which would give doctors more time to prepare interventions for patients in practical use
